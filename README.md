Source code for "Adaptively-Halting Policy Network for Early Classification", published at KDD'19.
Will be updated prior to KDD'19 conference.

**Update**: The available code is just the model right now, I am currently putting together a full training example with a detailed description of all pieces of the optimization process.

Current use:
```python
import numpy as np
```
